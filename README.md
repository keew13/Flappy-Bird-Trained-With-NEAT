# Flappy-Bird-Trained-With-NEAT
Learned to create an automated Flappy Bird game where in the bird is trained by the AI (Neural Network- NEAT) for multiple generations which results in it getting a near 100% score.<br>
The project was done from a learning perspective. Here's the link to the playlist of videos created on YouTube by Tech With Tim.<br>

I have additionally included the python file which I made by tweaking the training file, which when executed starts the game with the best bird and will probably go on forever.<br>
I am saying probably because it has been observed that once in a while the bird just randomly drops down out of nowhere. I shall come later and train it to much higher fitness. However if you want to do that for yourself make the necessary change in the training file.<br>
